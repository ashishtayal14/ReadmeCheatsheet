# ReadmeCheatsheet


## Headings

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2

## Emaphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## List

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  
   
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
   
Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

## Link
There are two ways to create links.

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 

## Inline HTML
You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

## Horizontal Rule

Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

## Emojis

GitHub supports emoji!
:+1: :sparkles: :camel: :tada:
:rocket: :metal: :octocat: 

[Supported git emojis](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)


<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0-YrRDlV0Gg
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/0-YrRDlV0Gg/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/0-YrRDlV0Gg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-YrRDlV0Gg)


## SHA 

Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.

```
16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac
mojombo@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac
mojombo/github-flavored-markdown@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac
```

## Issue references within a repository

Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

```
#1
mojombo#1
mojombo/github-flavored-markdown#1
```

## Username @mentions

Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.

## TeX Mathematical Formulae

A full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet. Here's a good reference, and you can try stuff out on CodeCogs. You can also play with formulae in the Markdown Here options page.

Here are some examples to try out:

$-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$
$x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}$
$\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$
The beginning and ending dollar signs ($) are the delimiters for the TeX markup.
